t# Gann-Square-Root-Calculator
This calculator applies Gann Theory to calculate price levels based on square root principles. Enter your base price, choose an adjustment type, and get the calculated price level.
Gann Theory is based on the relationship between price and time. This calculator uses the square root method to identify potential support and resistance levels. The formula takes the square root of a price, adds or subtracts an adjustment value, and then squares the result to find a new significant price level.
